      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Herbal medicine, a cornerstone of traditional Filipino healthcare, was formally recognized and safeguarded under <b><i>Republic Act No. 8423</b></i> or <b><i>Traditional and Alternative Medicine Act of 1997</b></i> enacted on Decemberâ€¯9,â€¯1997, and operational shortly thereafter, TAMA set a regulatory framework to ensure that herbal and traditional practices meet safety, efficacy, and ethical standards.</p>
    <h2><b>Policy Objectives and Public Health Goals</b></h2>
    <p>TAMA enshrines several guiding principles in its Declaration of Policy:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Integrate traditional and alternative healthcare into the national health system.</li>
    <li>Encourage scientific research to evaluate the safety, effectiveness, and cost-efficiency of traditional modalities.</li>
    <li>Promote ethical standards in the preparation, marketing, and use of herbal products</li>
  </ol>
  <h2><b>Creation and Role of PITAHC</b></h2>
  <p>A major legacy of the law was establishing the Philippine Institute of Traditional and Alternative Health Care (PITAHC)â€”a government agency under the Department of Health. PITAHC:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Leads scientific research and development of traditional medicine.</li>
    <li>Sets standards and codes of practice for herbal and alternative therapies.</li>
    <li>Oversees training, accreditation, quality control, and ethical conduct of practitioners and manufacturers.</li>
    <li>Promotes integration of traditional medicine into national health policies</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Regulation and FDA Partnership</h2>
<p>Under TAMA, herbal medicines must adhere to rigorous guidelines covering:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clinical evaluation: Validated via scientific research to confirm safety and efficacy.</li>
<li>Manufacturing standards: Enforced through Philippine current Good Manufacturing Practices for Natural Products (PCGMPâ€‘NP), benchmarked against WHO standards</li>
<li>Product registration and marketing: All herbal medicines must obtain FDA approval and meet labeling and packaging regulations. Once approved, they're listed in the National Traditional Medicine Formulary</li>
</ul>
<h2>Protection of Indigenous Knowledge</h2>
<p>TAMA takes a culturally sensitive stance by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recognizing the rights of indigenous communities over their traditional knowledge, giving them authority over how it's used.</li>
<li>Ensuring that any commercial utilization of indigenous herbal knowledge requires proper acknowledgment and equitable benefit-sharing</li>
</ul>
